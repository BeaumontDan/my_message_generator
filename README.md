### Description

This is a JavaScript training/learning project, set by [Codecademy][codecademy].

I chose the Codecademy example of Fortune Teller for my random message generator and inclued some random ASCII art.

### Codecademy Objective

##### Overview

Build a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program and version your project with Git/GitHub.

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

##### Project Goals

- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

### Setup

To run this project, install it locally using node and the file location:

`$ cd ../folder`
`$ node script.js`

### Technologies
